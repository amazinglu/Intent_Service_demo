using intent service the handle background task
communicate with UI thread using broadcast

intent broadcast -> broadcastReceiver

use implicit intent:
the intent action of broadcast and broadcastReceiver should be the same

use explicit intent:
the explicit intent only look for the target by search the name of the class in manifest
So using explicit intent, the broadcast receiver must be registered in manifest

In order to be able to register in manifest, the broadReceiver must have it own life cycle
So, if the broadReceiver is the inner class of a activity, can not use explicit intent
